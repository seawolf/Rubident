rubident is a multi-account, StatusNet (identi.ca etc.) and Twitter client written in Ruby
It supports OAuth v1 (soon v2), which it can set up for you.

To set up your accounts, log in to one of the supported sites and run:
	./rubident.rb setup
which will ask you to copy-and-paste a URL into your web browser.
Give rubident the number from the website, and you're set.

Read your 'home' timeline with:
	./rubident.rb home
and post to it with:
	./rubident.rb post "<message-enclosed-in-speech-marks>"

If you've set up more than one account, you will be asked to which account you'd like to use.

There are two files that you need before using rubident:
 1) ~/.rubident-keys
    this file must have the application's keys from the websites
 2) ~/.rubident
    this can be empty to start with, but will be used to store your keys made from that copy-and-pasted code.

There is some work to do on error handling and features such as replies, but reading and writing works for the most part :-)
